# [LZ] UserForums

Allow Xenforo Users to create and moderate forums

## Introduction

This is a list of features we would like to have in the initial release of this add-on:

* allow users to create forums
    * restrict this ability to certain usergroups
    * limit the number of forums a user can create based on usergroup 
* distinguish between a forum-moderator and forum-admin
    * the user who creates the forum will automatically be a forum-admin of the forum
    * forum-admins can:
        * add/remove moderators
        * delete the forum
        * make a forum private or public
    * forum-moderators can:
        * moderator posts/threads
        * approve post/threads
        * allow users into forum (if the forum is private)
* allow users to set a style from a set of installed styles
